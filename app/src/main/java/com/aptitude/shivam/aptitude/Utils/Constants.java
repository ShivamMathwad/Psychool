In this sub-test, spatial aptitude is assessed through items in which the need is to determine quickly how the figure will look like when seen through a mirror and how a figure will look like when folded in a particular way.\n\nSpatial aptitude is needed in all such courses and occupations/vocations that require an individual to visualise objects in 3-dimensions, such as in manufacturing industry, drafting, designing (fashion, interior, toys and games, jewellery, urban planning, landscape designing, etc.), architecture, astronomy, chemist, visual arts, animation, multimedia art, etc.";

    public static final String O_description = "Openness to experience has been described as the depth and complexity of an individual’s mental life and experiences. It is also sometimes called intellect or imagination. Openness to experience concerns people’s willingness to try to new things, their ability to be vulnerable, and their capability to think outside the box.\n\nPeople who are high in Openness are abstract thinkers, while people who are low in Openness are concrete thinkers.\n\nPeople who are high in Openness are comfortable with abstract ideas. They enjoy talking and thinking about theories and concepts, even if the concepts are unproven. They appreciate creative, original, innovative ideas, and enjoy thinking about the future and what it might hold. Because they appreciate ideas for their own sake, they usually enjoy the arts and other cultural pursuits. They are interested in having experiences that expand their minds and encourage them to think about things in a new way.\nPeople who are low in Openness are concrete, straightforward thinkers. They distrust ideas and theories that do not have practical, real-world applications. They prefer tradition and conventional ways over new, untested ideas. They are more realistic than creative and often have difficulty imagining things that they have not personally experienced. Because of this, they may be uninterested in trying new experiences, preferring instead to stick with what they know.";

They tend to be orderly, organized, and reliable. They are likely to excel in leadership positions.\nPeople who are low in Conscientiousness are less interested in long-term goals and more interested in responding to the moment. They are more fun-loving than hardworking, and are easily distracted. People low in Conscientiousness tend to abandon plans easily when something more attractive arises. They are often disorganized and go about tasks in a haphazard manner.";
    public static final String E_description = "This factor has two familiar ends of its spectrum: extroversion and introversion. It concerns where an individual draws their energy from and how they interact with others. In general, extroverts draw energy from or recharge by interacting with others, while Introverts (people low in Extraversion) get tired from interacting with others and replenish their energy by spending time alone.\n \nPeople high in extroversion tend to seek out opportunities for social interaction, where they are often the “life of the party.” They are outgoing, energetic, and friendly. They enjoy stimulation from other people and their environment, and gravitate to busy and active places. They express themselves easily and like to talk. Extroverts are enthusiastic about life and describe their experiences with colorful expressions of positive emotion. \nIntroverted people on the other hand are quiet, introspective, reserved, and thoughtful. They are easily overstimulated and avoid busy and noisy environments as they find them to be overwhelming. They often find it difficult to express themselves and may prefer others to do the talking.";
    public static final String A_description = "This factor concerns how well people get along with others. While extroversion concerns sources of energy and the pursuit of interactions with others, agreeableness concerns one’s orientation to others. It is a construct that rests on how an individual generally interacts with others.\nHighly Agreeable people are mostly concerned with getting along with others. People low in Agreeableness are mostly concerned with serving their own interests.\n \nPeople high in agreeableness tend to be well-liked, respected, and sensitive to the needs of others.
